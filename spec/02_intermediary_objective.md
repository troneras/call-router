- Integration tests for BullMQ job creation and processing
- End-to-end tests simulating Telnyx webhook delivery and job consumption
- Mock Redis and database connections for isolated testing

**Deliverables:**

- Test files covering API endpoint, queueing, and worker processing
- Test scripts runnable via `bun test` or similar
