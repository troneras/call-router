# How to Test and Verify the Solution

## Job 4: Verifying the Implementation

**Objective:**
Verify that the webhook handling and background processing system works end-to-end

**Key Results:**

- Automated tests pass for all components (API, queue, worker)
- Manual test: Send a Telnyx webhook payload to the deployed endpoint and confirm job is processed
- Check logs for both API and worker services on Railway
- Confirm data is updated in PostgreSQL as expected
- Validate error handling and retry logic in worker

**Deliverables:**

- Test results and logs
- Checklist confirming all verification steps
- Documentation of any issues or follow-ups
